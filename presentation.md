# different than closed source

## closed or open - you can't infer
### quality

# examples
## operating systems
## languages
## databases
## libraries
## frameworks

---

# operating systems
## linux
## (free, net, open)bsd
## ... and more
![](linux.jpg)
![](freebsd.jpg)
![](openbsd.jpg)
![](netbsd.png)

---

# languages
## python, scala, ruby, javascript
## ... and more
![](python.jpg)
![](scala.png)
![](ruby.jpg)
![](ecma.png)

^ technically, javascript is not open source, but implementations like v8 and
spidermonkey are and the ecmascript is really the language specification

---

# languages
## python, scala, ruby, javascript
## ... and more
![](python.jpg)
![](scala.png)
![](ruby.jpg)
![](ecma.png)

technically it's not javascript, it's ecmascript.
and ecmascript is actually an open standard, not code
but, javascript engines like V8 and SpiderMonkey are open source!

---

## some oss i use at work

---

# languages
## nix, scala, ruby, bash, javascript, thrift, protobufs

---

# services
## cassandra, kafka, mysql, sqlite, redis, memcached, nginx, apache

---

# frameworks and os
## linux, nixops, openssl, gerrit, nvim, chef, jenkins, finagle, sinatra, sidekiq, storm

---

# why?

---

## power and fear

![](sadness.jpg)

^ for all of our history people have been using the access to knowledge as means to oppress and keep power

---

## lone wolf
## (aka hero)

![150%,right](willy_on_your_own.jpg)

^ they have you believe that they are heroes or god-like in their abilities,
like they accomplished it all on their own

---

## code is infrastructure

![](infrastructure.jpg)

^ just like the freeway system and water ways, it enables more innovation and
more opportunity

---

## giving back
![300%](sharing-is-caring.jpg)

^ when you added a feature or fixed something, don't keep it to yourself - give
it back
^ i'm sure many of you modified a library to allow you to move forward with
your project, did you give it back to the original author of the library?

---

## if it's useful to you, it's probably useful to someone else

![200%, Right](makes_sense.png)

^ when you write something, make it available - even if you feel it's silly or
trivial -- who knows who will find it useful

---

# how?

* blog and do code review
* write bug reports or fix the bugs
* implement features
* write and update documentation
* improve tests
* ask questions in irc or gitter

---

# how?
## (owning)

---

## don't ask
### "should i make this open source?"

---

## instead ask
### "why should i not make this open source?"

## add an oss license
### (recommend mit)

---

## make sure your README is good
### (look at other well-regarded libraries)

---

## include a code of conduct
